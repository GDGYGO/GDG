# Generic Deck Generator - GDG

This is a Generic Deck Generator for EDOPRO/YGOPRO (or anything else compatible with .ydk files).

It starts from a pool of "generic" cards that don't belong to any archetype (or if they do, they aren't strictly dependant on it) and generates a deck.

Each card SHOULD be able to function within the deck i.e. rituals will have their spell, exodia will have its pieces, etc.

# Instructions

Further instructions are given if you read the "About" section of the program, but I'll say it anyway:

- pick GDG.jar or GDG.exe
- put it in your EDOPRO "deck" folder
- double click it
- click on "Make a random deck!"
- done!

There's no actual difference between GDG.jar and GDG.exe besides .exe having a cute icon.

If you can't run either of them, I suggest you download the latest version of java here https://www.java.com/en/download/ .

If you have other problems/inquiries, send me a mail at gdgygo@gmail.com.
